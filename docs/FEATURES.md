## 🔌 API Debugging

### Protocol Support
- ✅ HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2
- ✅ Full REST API methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, HEAD, OPTIONS
- ✅ SSE (Server-Sent Events)
- ✅ WebSocket

### Request Body Formats
- Form Data
- x-www-form-urlencoded
- JSON
- XML
- Binary

### Features
- ✅ File upload/download (drag & drop supported)
- ✅ Cookie auto-management and manual editing
- ✅ Visual editing for headers and query params
- ✅ Formatted response display (JSON, XML, HTML)
- ✅ Response time, status code, size statistics

### Self-hosted Mock Server
- ✅ Create workspace-scoped servers from the top-level **Mock Server** sidebar menu
- ✅ Collections are optional: link zero, one, or multiple collections and show all HTTP requests, including requests without a configured response
- ✅ Add standalone routes and edit status, headers, body, and delay without calling a real API or creating a collection first
- ✅ Create a server from a collection menu or add a Mock response from a request menu
- ✅ Keep collection-backed responses as Examples; persist standalone routes directly in `mock_servers.json`
- ✅ Match method/path/query, with optional named headers and JSON/text request bodies
- ✅ Select Examples with `x-mock-response-id`, `x-mock-response-name`, or `x-mock-response-code`
- ✅ Enable exact matching per call with `x-mock-match-request-body` or `x-mock-match-request-headers`
- ✅ Route-level **Code Mock** plus an optional global script through `pm.request`, `pm.response`, and `pm.state`
- ✅ `pm.*` completion, enabled state, API quick reference, and 8 curated built-in examples with preview and insert/replace actions
- ✅ CORS, server/route delay, per-call `x-mock-response-delay`, bounded/optional call logs, and `x-mock-session-id` state isolation
- ✅ Zero-dependency JDK `HttpServer` runtime with CPU-scaled workers and method-indexed routes for concurrent development and lightweight load tests
- ✅ Listen on all network interfaces by default and display a shareable LAN URL, with an optional shared `x-api-key`
- ✅ Store `mock_servers.json` beside `collections.json` in the current workspace so Git workspaces version them together
- ✅ Run headlessly with `mock run` after copying the workspace to a server or CI runner
- ✅ Copy the workspace-specific self-host command directly from the management page
- ✅ No EasyPostman cloud hosting, team permissions, external npm packages, or AI generation

Server example:

```bash
EASY_POSTMAN_MOCK_API_KEY=change-me \
java -jar easy-postman.jar mock run /path/to/workspace \
  --server "Payments Mock" --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3001
```

For internet-facing use, terminate HTTPS behind Nginx, Caddy, or a cloud load balancer and restrict the inbound firewall rule.

Script example:

```javascript
const input = JSON.parse(pm.request.body || "{}");
if (Number(input.amount) === 0.5) {
  pm.response.setStatusCode(402);
  pm.response.setBody(JSON.stringify({ status: "deny" }));
} else if (Number(input.amount) === 1.1) {
  pm.response.setStatusCode(200);
  pm.response.setBody(JSON.stringify({ status: "partial_approval" }));
}
```

`pm.request` exposes `method`, `path`, `body`, `header(name)`, `query(name)`, and `pathVariable(name)`. `pm.response` lets scripts set the status code, headers, body, and `delayMs`. State is memory-only and is discarded when cleared, when the runtime is refreshed, or when the app exits.

## 🤖 MCP and AI Clients

- ✅ Built-in standard MCP stdio Server for local clients such as Codex, Claude Desktop, Claude Code, and Cursor
- ✅ Native installers and the Windows portable package bundle `EasyPostmanMCP` with a JRE; no separate Java or MCP download is required
- ✅ List authorized workspaces, collections, environments, and saved requests without exposing environment values
- ✅ Select `workspaceId` and `environmentId` per tool call without changing the desktop app's current selection
- ✅ Run one saved HTTP request or a top-level collection through the existing inheritance, scripts, assertions, cookies, TLS, and HTTP execution pipeline
- ✅ Apply one-time `environmentOverrides` in memory without modifying workspace files
- ✅ Run alongside the desktop app and reuse one MCP process for the connection instead of restarting for every API call
- ✅ Bound response bodies and details, redact common credentials and error paths, and reserve stdout for MCP JSON-RPC
- 🔒 MCP can make real external requests and return API responses to its client; authorize only trusted clients and required workspaces

See the [MCP Server guide](MCP_SERVER_DESIGN_zh.md) for installation and complete boundaries.
